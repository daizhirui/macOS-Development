# Capture Screen For Multi Screens On Mac
There are many implementation about capture screen for mac.
<br>
A sample is in xcode sample code.
<br>
And mogutt also show code in https://github.com/mogutt/TTMacClient.
<br>
But on dual monitors mode, they are all not work,
<br>
even weixin's mac client and http://snip.qq.com/.
<br>
Only QQ is powerful and perfect.
<br>
And it's not open source.
<br>

#So, I try to do the capture screen sample to support dual monitors.
